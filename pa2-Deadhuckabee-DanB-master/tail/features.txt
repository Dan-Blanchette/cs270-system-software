- Added a feature to tail that allows the user to specify the number of lines
they want to read from the end of the file.

implemented as the argv[2] argument of the command line,
the function converts the base 10 number entered into
the number lines desired.

included is a test file for the feature rime.txt

*BUG*
will not report the very first line of a file but does not crash the program
